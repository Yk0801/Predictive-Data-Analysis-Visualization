 Predictive Data Analysis & Visualization

 This project demonstrates our ability to extract insights from real-world data using Python's powerful libraries. We focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model development, followed by effective visualization to present our findings.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visual tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Build predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Visualize key insights using interactive plots and charts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for building ML models
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for code execution and presentation

## 📊 Key Features

- Data preprocessing including handling null values, outliers, and encoding.
- Visual EDA to uncover trends and patterns.
- Machine Learning model creation and performance comparison.
- Interpretation of model results with charts and metrics.

## 📈 Results & Insights

We observed key patterns in the data and built predictive models that achieved promising accuracy scores. Visualizations provided a clear understanding of relationships between variables and outcomes.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Integrate more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Add a frontend dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time predictions.
